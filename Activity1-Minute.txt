The following minute shows my interview with the music management officer, Iresha.
Iresha: “First I want to explain my expectation about MusoPlan. I had an old computer to use for my job as a music management officer. I asked you to build this software to enter all my information easily. “
Nima:” who wants to access this program?”
Iresha: “me, reception, and also all musicians who work with me. I want when I open my program, I can see a part with the musician’s name. in this part I like to see a list of the musician. As I work with four kinds of musicians (guitarist, bassist, percussionist, and flutist) I like to see one different part for each musician.
At each part, I like to see descriptions depending on their instrument and their name, instrument, years playing, hourly rate.”
Nima:” Which kind of description?”
Iresha: “Later I will give some papers about all of my requirements.” 
Nima: “Do you have any conditions about the musician part, for example, the Name of the instrument that paly or years of playing?”
Iresha: “Yes of course. 
Their name must be between 3 and 30 characters. Years playing must be non-negative, must play one of the four instruments (guitar, bass, percussion and flout), and the hourly rate must be over 50.
And another thing, I like to see a troupe section on my page. I don’t know if you know about a troupe, or not. A troupe is a collection of musicians.
I would like to see a description of a troupe including the troupe's name, how many of which instruments it contains, what genre the troupe plays, The minimum duration of a booking, and The hourly rate for the whole troupe. 
I like to add musicians to the troupe and see their introduction.” 
Nima: “Do you have any condition about your troupe as same as musician part?”
Iresha: “Yes, I do. The troupe’s name must be between 3 and 30 characters. No more than 5 musicians in each troupe. Valid genre because I have just three genres, rock, jazz, and pop. Minimum duration in hours between 0.5 and 3.”
Nima: “you said the hourly rate, do you want to calculate the cost of deploying the troupe?”
Iresha: “Yes, I do.”
Nima: “So, may have a calculation formula?”
Iresha: “Yes, you may. I wrote it in those papers. I would like to read a file including a list of troupe names and also write the details description of all troupes in that file.”
Nima: “What format would you like to have for your file?”
Iresha: “All of the texts must be in text format because I am more familiar with it. Also, I like to have an empty file there to use for documentation whenever I need it.”
